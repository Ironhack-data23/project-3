# Introduction 
<div style="text-align:justify">

A year ago we founded DashGames Studio, a startup with an emphasis on the early stages of video game production. Unlike traditional gaming businesses, we prioritize the planning, pre-production and production of the video-games. Our goal is to enable independent game creators, to fully realize their imaginative visions.

In our first year, DashGames has become a vibrant community and resource hub for aspiring game designers. We offer workshops, mentorship, and a platform for collaboration, ensuring that independent creators have the tools and support needed to navigate the complexities of game development.

As the year unfolded, DashGames saw the creation of several exciting games, each contributing to the company's success. However, one game, [Midas Merge](https://wildlifestudios.com/games/midas-merge/), soared to the Top 1 spot in both iOS and Android rankings, marking a significant milestone for our startup.

Fueled by the success of Midas Merge and the dedication of our talented team, we've reached a point where we can establish our first office anywhere in the world. As we embark on this new chapter, we've set specific criteria for our office location to ensure a thriving and balanced work environment.

Our ideal office location includes:

1. Proximity to Design Companies.
2. Close to Schools.
3. Nearby Starbucks.
4. Proximity to Airports.
5. Close to Clubs or Bars
6. Nearby basketball places
7. Nearby dog hairdresser

With these considerations in mind, we are excited to establish our first global office, where creativity, collaboration, and innovation can thrive in a dynamic and supportive environment. As DashGames continues to grow, we look forward to building on our successes and exploring new horizons in the world of gaming.


# Comparative study

This study was divided into 3 parts:

Part I, contains the access to the companies database, through MongoDB. From which I filtered to just obtain those **gaming** start-ups which have between 90 and 140 **employees**, from all around the world. After filtering, I notice that most of the result companies where located in the USA, and mainly located in California (San Francisco and Los Angeles cities) and New York (New York city) States.

Part II, contains the search of every requeriment mention above. Finally, each office location is maped, and all locations that were requieres are added to the main map. 
- Airport: gray background plane icon.
- Basketball: orange basketball icon.
- Clubs: Lightred background beer icon.
- Pet: purple background paw icon.
- Starbucks: green coffee icon. 
- Schools: blue background white graduation-cap icon.
- Train station: black background train icon.
- Specific office I choose: red backgroung hand icon.

Finally, Part III in which a final decision is made based on the price of the square meter per each city, and the distance between
each required place and the selected office.

### Visualization 
Map visualization of each city:

<p align="center">
<img src="images\LA.png" alt="image" style="width:500px;height:auto;">
</div>

Observing the various maps, it is evident that all the cities fulfill the specified criteria. Consequently, I conducted an additional analysis to determine the distances between these locations and our main office.


|    Places   | San Francisco |   New York   | Los Angeles |
|    :---:    |     :---:     |     :---:    |    :---:    |
|  Starbucks  |    609.72m    |    550.57m   |   1164.58m  |
|   Schools   |    1125.45m   |    904.79m   |   705.79m   |
|   Airport   |    427.521m   |   2047.453m  |   1196.97m  |
|    Clubs    |    309.42m    |    873.88m   |   1849.06m  |
|  Basketball |    1406.78m   |   1273.58m   |   613.96m   |
|    Pets     |     50.86m    |    450.54m   |   624.03m   |

The optimal office location would be positioned between the cities of New York and San Francisco. Nevertheless, any of the identified cities would serve as a favorable option.

Now, a critical decision lies ahead: New York or San Francisco?

Considering this is our inaugural office studio and our goal is to save money for future business expansions, the prudent choice is to select the location with the more cost-effective sales or rental options. To make an informed decision, I conducted web scraping to gather data on square-meter prices in these cities. While attempts were made to scrape official websites containing real office listings, unfortunately, they were not accessible.

Here are the results obtained: 

|    Ranki   |    Location       |   Price   | 
|    :---:   |     :---:         |  :---:    |  
|    1 (2)   | New York, NY      |   15900$  | 
|    2 (4)   | San Francisco, CA |   13518$  |  
|    3 (12)  | Los Angeles, CA   |    9531$  |

With significant disparities in prices across various cities, our initial preferences, New York and San Francisco, presented diverse cost implications. After thorough evaluation, the decision leans towards financial prudence. Consequently, we have chosen San Francisco as the location for our inaugural office studio. This strategic move aligns with our commitment to maximizing resources for the future growth of our gaming business.
