# Introduction 
<div style="text-align:justify">

A year ago we founded DashGames Studio, a startup with an emphasis on the early stages of video game production. Unlike traditional gaming businesses, we prioritize the planning, pre-production and production of the video-games. Our goal is to enable independent game creators, to fully realize their imaginative visions.

In our first year, DashGames has become a vibrant community and resource hub for aspiring game designers. We offer workshops, mentorship, and a platform for collaboration, ensuring that independent creators have the tools and support needed to navigate the complexities of game development.

As the year unfolded, DashGames saw the creation of several exciting games, each contributing to the company's success. However, one game, [Midas Merge](https://wildlifestudios.com/games/midas-merge/), soared to the Top 1 spot in both iOS and Android rankings, marking a significant milestone for our startup.

Fueled by the success of Midas Merge and the dedication of our talented team, we've reached a point where we can establish our first office anywhere in the world. As we embark on this new chapter, we've set specific criteria for our office location to ensure a thriving and balanced work environment.

Our ideal office location includes:

1. Proximity to Design Companies.
2. Close to Schools.
3. Nearby Starbucks.
4. Proximity to Airports.
5. Close to Clubs or Bars
6. Nearby basketball places
7. Nearby dog hairdresser

With these considerations in mind, we are excited to establish our first global office, where creativity, collaboration, and innovation can thrive in a dynamic and supportive environment. As DashGames continues to grow, we look forward to building on our successes and exploring new horizons in the world of gaming.


# Comparative study

This study was divided into 3 parts:

Part I, contains the access to the companies database, through MongoDB. From which I filtered to just obtain those **gaming** start-ups which have between 90 and 140 **employees**, from all around the world. After filtering, I notice that most of the result companies where located in the USA, and mainly located in California (San Francisco and Los Angeles cities) and New York (New York city) States.

Part II, contains the search of every requeriment mention above. Finally, each office location is maped, and all locations that were requieres are added to the main map. 
- Airport: gray background plane icon.
- Basketball: orange basketball icon.
- Clubs: Lightred background beer icon.
- Pet: purple background paw icon.
- Starbucks: green coffee icon. 
- Schools: blue background white graduation-cap icon.
- Train station: black background train icon.
- Specific office I choose: red backgroung hand icon.

Finally, Part III in which a final decision is made based on the price of the square meter per each city, and the distance between
each required place and the selected office.
